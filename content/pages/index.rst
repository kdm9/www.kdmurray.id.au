This is the web presence of ùú• (Kevin Murray).

I'm an aspiring bioinformatician working with low-level sequence analysis and
image anlaysis for plant intergrative genomics and phenomics. I work in the
`Borevitz Lab, at ANU <http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au>`_. My current projects
include `axe <https://github.com/kdmurray91/axe>`_ and `TraitCapture
<http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au/traitcapture>`_.

In my spare time, I write (small) bits of code for various open source projects
including `tor <https://torproject.org>`_ and others...

Otherwise, I like riding bikes, cooking vegetables, and failing to play guitar
and card games.
