PhD
---

I'm currently a PhD student in Justin Borevitz's lab in the ARC Centre of
Excellence in Plant Energy Biology at the Austalian National University
(Canberra). My project title is *"Novel algorithms for population-scale
analysis of plant genomes"*. My thesis is focused on improving the analysis
software used in plant population genomics, particularly in very large
population studies.

As part of my PhD, I'm working on:

- My new tool, ``kWIP``: The `k-mer Weighted Inner Product
  <https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip>`_, a novel de-novo, alignment free way of
  calculating kinship between samples from next-gen sequencing reads.

Free software
