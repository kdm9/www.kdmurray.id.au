PhD
---

I'm currently a PhD student in Justin Borevitz's lab in the ARC Centre of
Excellence in Plant Energy Biology at the Austalian National University
(Canberra). My proposed title is "Novel algorithms for population-scale
analysis of plant genomes". My thesis is focused on improving the analysis
software used in plant population genomics, particularly in very large
population studies.

As part of my PhD, I'm working on:

- My new tool, ``kWIP``: The `k-mer Weighted Inner Product
  <https://github.com/kdmurray91/kwip>`_, a novel de-novo, alignment free way of
  calculating kinship between samples from next-gen sequencing reads.
- A k-mer analysis and genome assebly tool/libary, `khmer
  <https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer>`_. This tool was created and is maintained
  by the Data-Intensive Biology lab of C. Titus Brown. I am upstreaming many
  patches and minor features made during the development of ``kwip``.
