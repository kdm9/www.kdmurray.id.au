If you can't get an IP address on eth0, there are a few things to check:

- `ifconfig` eth0 probably won't appear if it has no IP
- `ifconfig eth0` will show that the interface is there, and its HWAddr (MAC).
- `route -n` will show an empty routing table

Now, check `dhclient eth0`. If you're as big a fool as I, it won't be installed
and you should set the address manually.

Moral of the story: **check the DHCP client is installed if your setup depends
on DHCP**
